# `raidtomi`

Raidtomi is a Web-based tool for Max Raid RNG manipulation in Pok√©mon Sword and Shield (Gen 8). Core seed searching and RNG logic is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly using [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen). You can try it online at [raidtomi.com](https://raidtomi.com).

The goal is to combine the Web-based convenience of [Leanny's Seed Checker](https://leanny.github.io/seedchecker/) with the performance of native desktop tools like [RaidFinder](https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/RaidFinder).

### Compatibility

Currently, Raidtomi only works in desktop Firefox and Chrome, and Android mobile browsers. This is because Safari [does not currently support](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190800) BigInt64Array and BigUint64Array, both of which are used in wasm-bindgen.

## Locations

In general:

- `src` contains TypeScript and React code
- `crate` contains Rust code

Notable parts of the codebase:

- [crate/src/core/frame.rs](https://github.com/sliminality/raidtomi/blob/master/crate/src/core/frame.rs) contains all raid generation logic [as documented](https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/RNGWriteups/blob/master/Gen%208/Raid%20Generation.md)
- [crate/src/personal_data.rs](https://github.com/sliminality/raidtomi/blob/master/crate/src/personal_data.rs) constructs the in-memory personal table. This file can be mostly generated using [crate/src/core/personal.rs](https://github.com/sliminality/raidtomi/blob/master/crate/src/core/personal.rs), which reads the personal binary.
- [src/helpers/data/dens.ts](https://github.com/sliminality/raidtomi/blob/master/src/helpers/data/dens.ts) contains the den listings
